# Overview
I am running the Sims 3 game modded on linux. The mods that are packages work fine. But sims3pack files were giving me trouble as the launcher fails to run. There exists windows based solutions but none seemed portable, nor did they expose how it worked. Thus I started to write my own.

# No Frills
This is (currently) a no-frills approach. I suspect there are few that are playing the game and/or care about a game that is OBE (Sims 4).
